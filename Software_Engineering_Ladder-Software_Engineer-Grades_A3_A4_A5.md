#Software Engineering Ladder (v.1.0.0-Beta)
### _Software Engineer (Grades A3, A4, A5)_

##Technical Skills (Dex)
You are developing a deep expertise in a core language and / or technology, and gaining awareness of others.

You understand and make well-reasoned design decisions and trade-offs in your solution area.

You arrive at the required implementation given periodic input from peers. You mentor and code review those developers less experienced than you. You also provide recommendations on approaches to take.

You participate in the design of software components (with guidance).

You are able to debug and solve problems in your own code or others code, with support or guidance from colleagues.

You are able to work effectively and collaboratively with colleagues from other disciplines (e.g. Tester, BA, Platform engineer) and have an appreciation of how your development decisions impact their work.


####A4
You are comfortable working independently on larger software components.

You design small software components, and understand how they combine with others to form a complete system.

You have an appreciation of non-functional requirements (e.g. performance, security, accessibility), their importance, and knowledge of tools used to verify they have been met. 

You have a methodical and reasoned approach to debugging and problem solving.

You are able to work effectively in areas outside your core competency with guidance i.e as a Tester, a BA, a Platform Engineer, etc.
