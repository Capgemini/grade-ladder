This grade-ladder both took inspiration from, and evolved out of [Camille Fournier](http://twitter.com/skalille)'s [Rent the Runway grade ladder](http://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/ladder) (which in turn took its inspiration from the original Foursquare Engineering Ladder made by Harry Heymann, Jason Liszka and Andrew Hogue).

For us in Capgemini UK, we had the following four User Stories which we wanted to address:

* Attraction of potential recruits – this is how we value your skills at Capgemini
* Pre-interview – what grade might I be at Capgemini?
* Onboarding – I’ve just started at Capgemini, what is expected of me?
* Promotion – I want to get promoted. How do I get to the next grade?

We acknowledge that, while we tried to make them as future-proof as possible, these documents will change over time.  That's why we're putting them on github.
