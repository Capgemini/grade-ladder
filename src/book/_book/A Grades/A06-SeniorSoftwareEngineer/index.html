<h2 id="technical-skills-dex">Technical Skills (Dex)</h2>
<p>You are a respected expert in your core language / technology and are sought for your opinion and guidance.</p>
<p>You identify and promote shared development approaches, embedding them within your team_s practices. You are aware of emerging industry best practices and can lead initiatives to determine their appropriateness for use in your team.</p>
<p>You care about the quality of the codebase and are continually looking for ways to improve it, as well as the experience of working with it.</p>
<p>You understand the architecture, how it is delivered and run in production, and the impact your changes may have on it.</p>
<p>You provide technical advice and input to technical decisions which impact your team and the wider project.</p>
<p>You are able to non-functionally test and tune the components for which you are responsible (e.g. in areas of performance, security, accessibility, etc.)</p>
<p>You anticipate technical issues at the component level, communicate these clearly to the relevant stakeholders, and make architectural / design decisions to avoid or resolve them.</p>
<p>When encountering technical challenges you are able to find the underlying issues and patterns; and take a new perspective when required, even when these are outside your immediate problem domain.</p>
<h2 id="soft-skills-t">Soft Skills (T)</h2>
<p>You are able to present technical concepts in a way that non-technical stakeholders fully understand. You are able to effectively communicate complex concepts including systems, but also processes and plans. Your written communication is clear, concise and uses simple language.</p>
<p>You recognise that a strong team is one which brings together the most diverse group of people. You create a genuinely inclusive team environment where everyone feels welcome, heard and valued, no matter what their background.

<p>You provide estimates for your work and your teams work, even when there is uncertainty around the requirements. You include assumptions and rationale to support the estimates.</p>
<p>You are capable, given a prioritised backlog, of planning and tracking the work of a development team.</p>
<h2 id="impact-wis">Impact (Wis)</h2>

<p>You are capable of taking components and breaking them into sub-components ready for development and delivery.</p>
<p>You help the team cope with flexible scope or technical uncertainty.</p>
<p>You look at test cases and advise QA on adjacent code / regression impact.</p>
<p>You have a high-level understanding of other components in the solution.</p>
<p>You are capable of providing LIVE support for your area, including components you are not fully familiar with.</p>
<p>You document these components in a manner that is useful for other developers and architects.</p>
<p>You are present whenever your component(s) go live for the first time, and whenever there are significant subsequent changes.</p>
<h3 id="technical-assessment-and-adoption">Technical Assessment and Adoption</h3>
<p>You have a good knowledge of current technology industry trends in your chosen domain.</p>
<p>You evaluate and select new technologies and tools for the benefit of your project.
