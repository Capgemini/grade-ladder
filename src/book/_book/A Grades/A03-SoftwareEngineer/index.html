<p>You are capable of working with non-technical stakeholders to fully understand a project&apos;s requirements.</p>
<h3 id="technical-assessment-and-adoption">Technical Assessment and Adoption</h3>

<h3 id="business-awareness">Business Awareness</h3>
<p>You fully understand the business cases and functional / non-functional (e.g. performance, security, accessibility) requirements supported by your feature(s).</p>
<h3 id="helping-your-colleagues">Helping Your Colleagues</h3>
