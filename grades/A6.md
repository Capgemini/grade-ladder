You identify and promote shared development approaches, embedding them within your team's practices. You are aware of emerging industry best practices and can lead initiatives to determine their appropriateness for use in your team.

You care about the quality of the codebase and are continually looking for ways to improve it, as well as the experience of working with it.

You understand the architecture, how it is delivered and run in production, and the impact your changes may have on it.

You provide technical advice and input to technical decisions which impact your team and the wider project.

You are able to non-functionally test and tune the components for which you are responsible (e.g. in areas of performance, security, accessibility, etc.)

You anticipate technical issues at the component level, communicate these clearly to the relevant stakeholders, and make architectural / design decisions to avoid or resolve them.
